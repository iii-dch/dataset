            "value": "Jerusalem Captured: the Holy City Wrested form the TurksThe capture of Jerusalem by British troops is one of the most momentous episodes of the War. For centuries the Holy City groaned under the oppression of the Turks, who tyranised over Christians and Jews alike, and outraged Moslem feeling by their brutal persecution of the Arabs. Since the Sultan of Turkey became, for all practical purposes, the vassal of the German Emperor, matters went from bad to worse, and the interests of the peoples of Palestine were ruthlessly subordinated to the demands of German military and commercial policy. The British troops have entered Jerusalem, not as conquerors, but as liberators, and their advent has been joyfully welcomed alike by Moslems, by Christians, and by Jews. By this historic stroke, Jerusalem has been freed from an age-long tyranny, and a prosperous future has been opened up for the virile and intelligent races who inhabit the soil of Palestine.The occupation of Jerusalem comes as the climax of a rapid and brilliant campaign, and was preceded by the successive captures of Beersheba, Gaza, and Jaffa. Operations were carried on under the most arduous circumstances, and the oppressive heat and choking dust, followed by heavy rain which made roads, fields, and tracks a mass of slippery mud, imposed intense hardships upon troops accustomed to very different climatic conditions. All difficulties, however, have been overcome with indomitable perseverance, and the Turk has sustained the most crushing disaster which has yet befallen his arms. The photographs show (1) a panoramic view of Jerusalem; (2) General Sir Edmund Allenby, Commander of the British Forces in Palestine; (3) a view of the south wall of Jerusalem, from the lower part of the Valley of Jehoshaphat, showing on the right, the south-east corner of the wall and the grounds of the Mosque of Omar; (4) a view of part of the north wall, showing, on the right, the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and, on the left, the dome of the Mosque of Omar; (5) part of the citadel and the west wall of Jerusalem, showing the road extending from the Jaffa Gate, down the slope of Mount Zion. and across the plain of Rephaim, towards Bethlehem.（エルサレム攻略：トルコ軍から聖なる都市を奪取）"
